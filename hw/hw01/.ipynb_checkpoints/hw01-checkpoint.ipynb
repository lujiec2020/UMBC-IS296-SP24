Your responses to this survey will be used to understand the strengths and weaknesses of current campus offerings. It will also be used to improve data science education at UMBC and at other campuses around the country that are now adopting data science programs. Participation is optional. Your participation in the study will not affect your grades. None of your instructors will see your individual responses or whether you participated. As a thanks for your completion of the survey, you have the option to receive a $5 Amazon gift card OR be entered into a drawing for a 50 US dollars Amazon gift card. The survey should take about 10 minutes. Please complete the survey here: https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5nlPHyJu7GwMUXI\n"
